<p> ATM stands for applied technology magnet. You have to do ATM for your threes years of middle school. During my years in ATM I've learned multiple skills.In sixth grade I learned multiple skills like learning how to type.

In seventh grade I was introduced many different magnets like Floor planner, Photoshop, photography, and sketchup.
In sketchup I was able to work with a group of three for a project. This assignment helped me understand what it takes to work with a group other than yourself.
Photoshop showed me how to be creative with my work other than having a simple picture or font for a flyer or projects in my future. 
Photography allowed me to edit and change up the vibe of a picture. This unit really helped me by showing me how to properly take a picture to show effection to people, so they can relate.
Floor planner really helped me understand how much time and effort it takes to build something as simple as a classroom.</p>
