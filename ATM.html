<h2>
    What is ATM?
</h2>
<p> ATM stands for applied technology magnet. You have to do ATM for your threes years of middle school. During my years in ATM I've learned multiple skills.In sixth grade I learned how to type. Learning how to type made a huge impact on my school work because if a task in class requires me to type I can get a lot accomplished during class time.Internet saftey is something you learn in sixth grade to help protect you from dangerous people who search for innocent kids on the internet. I learned how to take my social media off of the internet for anyone to see.
In seventh grade I was introduced many different magnets like Floor planner, Photoshop, photography, and sketchup.
In sketchup I was able to work with a group of three for a project. This assignment helped me understand what it takes to work with a group other than yourself.
Photoshop showed me how to be creative with my work other than having a simple picture or font for a flyer or projects in my future. 
Photography allowed me to edit and change up the vibe of a picture. This unit really helped me by showing me how to properly take a picture to show effection to people, so they can relate.
Floor planner really helped me understand how much time and effort it takes to build something as simple as a classroom.</p>
    <p>Creating my own video for a cause I really wanted to support was very interesting. I know when people get bullied it can begin to be extreme and 
        we need kids to stand up for those who are afraid to . </p>

<p>Reflection of the program:
Overall,ATM is a really cool program it prepares you for future assignments and allows you to discover skills you didnâ€™t even know you had naturally like typing.</p>
