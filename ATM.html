<h2>
    What is ATM?
</h2>
<p> ATM stands for applied technology magnet. You have to do ATM for your threes years of middle school. In sixth grade I learned multiple skills.</p>
<li> In sixth grade I learned multiple skills like learning how to type. Learning how to type made a huge impact on my school work because if a task in class requires me to type I can get a lot accomplished during class time.Internet saftey is something you learn in sixth grade to help protect you from dangerous people who search for innocent kids on the internet. I learned how to take my social media off of the internet for anyone to see.</li>
